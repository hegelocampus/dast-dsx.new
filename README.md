WIP: Transpiler that allows you to use JSX like syntax in Dart (DSX)
Forked from [dart-sass](https://github.com/hegelocampus/dart-dsx)

Disclaimers:
- this is not an official Google product.
- Most of the code written in here is not my own and I do not intend to claim ownership of it.
- This project is a major work in project and it is not currently working in any capacity and probably won't be anytime soon, this is mostly just to dip my toes in the water and see if this sort of compiler even makes sense for DSX.
